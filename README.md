AI Content Moderation System

Introduction
This project implements an automated content moderation system that classifies textual content as appropriate or inappropriate for public display. Leveraging machine learning models (LSTM and BERT) and natural language processing techniques, the system analyzes textual data in real-time to provide classification results. Additionally, the project extends its functionality to extract text from images and memes (using Google Cloud Vision API ), enabling classification based on the extracted textual content.
